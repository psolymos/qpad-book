# About the course

You'll learn

- how to analyze your point count data when it combines different methodologies/protocols/technologies,
- how to violate assumptions and get away with it.

***

# About me

- Ecologist (molluscs, birds),
- pretty good at stats (modeling, detectability, data cloning, multivariate),
- R programmer (vegan, detect, ResourceSelection, pbapply),
- sometimes I teach (like today).

# Apples and oranges

_"A comparison of apples and oranges occurs when two items or groups of items are compared that 
cannot be practically compared."_ [_Wikipedia_]

How we measure things can have big impact on our results.

- You might say: I saw 5 robins (walking down the road),
- I might say: I only saw one (sitting on my porch)

***

# Apples to apples

Effort:

- area of the physical space searched,
- amount of time spent,
- number of individuals identified.

Experience, skill, "sensitivity":

- number of years in field work,
- eye sight, hearing ability,
- mic sensitivity.

The goal is to make our measurements comparable.

10-min unlimited count ~300% increase over 3-min 50-m count. 
Average across 54 species of boreal songbirds[^1].

# So what is a point count?

- A trained observer 
- records all the birds 
- seen and heard 
- from a point count station 
- for a set period of time
- within a defined distance radius.

***

# Questions we want to answer using point counts

- How many? (Abundance, density, population size)
- Is this location part of the range? (0/1)
- How is abundance changing in space? (Distribution)
- How is abundance changing in time? (Trend)
- What is the effect of a treatment on abundance?

***

# Standardization by design

Have a set of standards/recommendations that people will follow to

- maximize efficiency in the numbers of birds and species counted,
- minimize extraneous variability in the counts[^2].

But programs started to deviate from standards:

_"For example, only 3% of 196,000 point counts conducted during the period
1992--2011 across Alaska and Canada followed the standards recommended for the count period and count radius."_[^1]

# Protocols do vary

Survey methodology variation (colors) among contributed projects
in the Boreal Avian Modelling (BAM) data base as of 2014[^3].

# Pop quiz

- In what regard can protocols differ?
- What drives protocol variation among projects?
- Why have we abandoned following protocols?

***

# Moving away from standards

- Detection probabilities might vary even with fixed effort (we'll cover this more later),
- programs might have their own goals and constraints (access, training, etc).

***

# Model based approaches

Less labour intensive methods for unmarked populations has come to the forefront:

- double observer ([Nichols et al. 2000](https://doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2000)117[0393:ADOAFE]2.0.CO;2)),
- distance sampling ([Buckland et al. 2001](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/introduction-to-distance-sampling-9780198509271)),
- removal sampling ([Farnsworth et al. 2002](https://doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[0414:ARMFED]2.0.CO;2)),
- multiple visit occupancy ([MacKenzie et al. 2002](https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2248:ESORWD]2.0.CO;2)),
- multiple visit abundance ([Royle 2004](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00142.x)).

***

# Models come with assumptions

- Population is closed during multiple visits,
- observers are independent,
- all individuals emit cues with identical rates,
- spatial distribution of individuals is uniform,
- etc. (we will investigate this further in depth).

***

# Assumptions are everywhere

Although assumptions are everywhere, we are really good at ignoring them:

- Relativistic time dilation is negligible (as long as we are not on a space station),
- samples are independent.

***

# Pop quiz

- Can you mention some other common assumptions?
- Can you explain why we neglect/violate assumptions?

# The hard truth

Assumptions are violated in many ways, because we seek simplicity.

The main question we have to ask: **does it matter in practice**?

***

# Our approach

1. We will introduce a concept,
2. understand how we can infer it from data,
3. then we recreate the situation _in silico_,
4. and see how the outcome changes as we make different assumptions.

It is guaranteed that we violate **every** assumption we make.

To get away with it, we need to understand **how much is too much**.

_"All assumptions are violated, but some are more than others."_
