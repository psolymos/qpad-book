# Two quotes

All models are wrong but some are useful

All data are messy but some are missing

# The evil trio

- Space
- Time
- Taxonomy

# Sample and replication

- We want to make inferences about a population,
- full census is out of reach,
- thus we take a sample of the population
- that is representative and random.
- Ideally, sample size should be as large as possible,
- it reduces variability and 
- increases statistical power.

# How do we pick where to survey?

- Stratification,
- gradients,
- random location to control for unmeasured effects,
- take into account historical surveys (avoid, or revisit),
- accessibility/cost (clusters).
