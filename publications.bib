Abstract = {{Subspecies richness (average number of subspecies per species = SSP/SP)
   has traditionally been explained by niche breadth, characteristics of
   the preferred habitat ({''}habitat hypothesis{''}), dispersal ability,
   range size ({''}range size hypothesis{''}), etc. However, in several
   invertebrate groups, there are striking differences between SSP/SP
   across families, which cannot be explained using classic arguments, and
   we might assume some hidden factor in the background. For example, some
   families of terrestrial molluscs, that possess conspicuously more
   subspecies than others, have higher degree of morphological complexity
   (shell size, number of diagnosable shell characters), for which we
   propose the ``artefact hypothesis.{''} According to this, morphological
   complexity plays an important role in taxonomists' subspecies
   recognition. We used shell size, number of characters mentioned in
   species descriptions and area extent in six European land snail
   families, and habitat characteristics (rock-dwelling vs.
   non-rock-dwelling) in one largest European snail families (Clausiliidae)
   to test our hypothesis. We found that all three factors (range size,
   morphological complexity and habitat type) correlated positively with
   the SSP/SP ratio. Although the generality of our findings has to be
   tested in other invertebrate phyla, we provide examples of striking
   differences between SSP/SP ratios in butterflies (Lepidoptera) and
   beetles (Coleoptera) as well. Our findings imply that researchers (a)
   should use the number of SSP more carefully in comprehensive studies,
   and (b) should maintain and use the rank subspecies in order to provide
   a stronger status for the species rank, and avoid taxonomic inflation.
   Furthermore, the subspecies rank might be more useful for ``cryptic
   species{''} (clades that are indistinguishable morphologically) than
   species.}},

Abstract = {{We used conventional and finite mixture removal models with and without
   time-varying covariates to evaluate availability given presence for 152
   bird species using data from point counts in boreal North America. We
   found that the choice of model had an impact on the estimability of
   unknown model parameters and affected the bias and variance of corrected
   counts. Finite mixture models provided better fit than conventional
   removal models and better adjusted for count duration. However, reliably
   estimating parameters and minimizing variance using mixture models
   required at least 200-1,000 detections. Mixture models with time-varying
   proportions of infrequent singers were best supported across species,
   indicating that accounting for date- and time-related heterogeneity is
   important when combining data across studies over large spatial scales,
   multiple sampling time frames, or variable survey protocols. Our
   flexible and continuous time-removal modeling framework can be used to
   account for such heterogeneity through the incorporation of easily
   obtainable covariates, such as methods, date, time, and location.
   Accounting for availability bias in bird surveys allows for better
   integration of disparate studies at large spatial scales and better
   adjustment of local, regional, and continental population size

Abstract = {{Avian acoustic communication has resulted from evolutionary pressures
   and ecological constraints. We therefore expect that auditory
   detectability in birds might be predictable by species traits and
   phylogenetic relatedness. We evaluated the relationship between
   phylogeny, species traits, and field-based estimates of the two
   processes that determine species detectability (singing rate and
   detection distance) for 141 bird species breeding in boreal North
   America. We used phylogenetic mixed models and cross-validation to
   compare the relative merits of using trait data only, phylogeny only, or
   the combination of both to predict detectability. We found a strong
   phylogenetic signal in both singing rates and detection distances;
   however the strength of phylogenetic effects was less than expected
   under Brownian motion evolution. The evolution of behavioural traits
   that determine singing rates was found to be more labile, leaving more
   room for species to evolve independently, whereas detection distance was
   mostly determined by anatomy (i.e. body size) and thus the laws of
   physics. Our findings can help in disentangling how complex ecological
   and evolutionary mechanisms have shaped different aspects of
   detectability in boreal birds. Such information can greatly inform
   single- and multi-species models but more work is required to better
   understand how to best correct possible biases in phylogenetic diversity

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Taxon co-occurrence analysis is commonly used in ecology, but it
   has not been applied to range-wide distribution data of partly
   allopatric taxa because existing methods cannot differentiate between
   distribution-related effects and taxon interactions. Our first aim was
   to develop a taxon co-occurrence analysis method that is also capable of
   taking into account the effect of species ranges and can handle
   faunistic records from museum databases or biodiversity inventories. Our
   second aim was to test the independence of taxon co-occurrences of
   rock-dwelling gastropods at different taxonomic levels, with a special
   focus on the Clausiliidae subfamily Alopiinae, and in particular the
   genus Montenegrina.
   Location: Balkan Peninsula in south-eastern Europe (46N-36N, 13.5E-28E).
   Methods: We introduced a taxon-specific metric that characterizes the
   occurrence probability at a given location. This probability was
   calculated as a distance-weighted mean of the taxon's presence and
   absence records at all sites. We applied corrections to account for the
   biases introduced by varying sampling intensity in our dataset. Then we
   used probabilistic null-models to simulate taxon distributions under the
   null hypothesis of no taxon interactions and calculated pairwise and
   cumulated co-occurrences. Independence of taxon occurrences was tested
   by comparing observed co-occurrences to simulated values.
   Results: We observed significantly fewer co-occurrences among species
   and intra-generic lineages of Montenegrina than expected under the
   assumption of no taxon interaction.
   Main conclusions: Fewer than expected co-occurrences among species and
   intrageneric clades indicate that species divergence preceded niche
   partitioning. This suggests a primary role of non-adaptive processes in
   the speciation of rock-dwelling gastropods. The method can account for
   the effects of distributional constraints in range-wide datasets, making
   it suitable for testing ecological, biogeographical, or evolutionary
   hypotheses where interactions of partly allopatric taxa are in question.}},

   autonomous recordings}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is one of the longest
   annual avian surveys and has the greatest spatiotemporally extensive
   coverage in the Western Hemisphere. Although this important survey
   provides trend estimates for more than 400 species, it has limited
   coverage in the boreal forest and biases in representation and
   detectability that complicate inference. Thus, there is a need to
   evaluate the potential of new technologies and analytical approaches to
   increase coverage and improve monitoring efficiency. We documented
   variation in counts between BBS surveys (hereafter ``human BBS{''}) and
   different on-road and forest-edge surveys using autonomous recording
   units (ARUs) from 3 routes in the Northwest Territories, Canada.
   Specifically, we quantified percent differences (i.e., bias in counts)
   in species richness, abundance indices of birds, and species-specific
   variation in counts between human BBS and ARU-based surveys conducted
   on-road and at the forest edge at different dates and times of day. We
   also generated on-road effective detection radius (EDR) estimates for 15
   species and tested for species-specific differences in EDR to explain
   bias in counts between on-road and forest-edge ARU surveys. Overall,
   species richness and abundance indices in human BBS surveys were higher
   than forest-edge ARU surveys conducted simultaneously and when similar
   forest-edge ARU surveys were conducted at sunset and a week earlier in
   June. However, there was no difference when comparing values from human
   BBS with on-road ARU BBS and forest-edge ARU surveys conducted at
   sunrise. Extracting the maximum count per species from 4 types of
   3-minute forest-edge surveys increased counts by 62\% and 64\% for
   species richness and abundance indices, respectively, relative to human
   BBS, but the importance of this bias differed considerably among the 10
   most common species in the study area. Our results suggest that
   false-negative bias in species detection could be corrected with
   appropriate methods, and ARUs deployed at the forest edge near BBS stops
   could be used to increase data quality of on-road surveys. When combined
   with appropriate correction factors to adjust for surveys done at the
   forest edge, ARUs could also be used to increase the geographic coverage
   of boreal surveys by allowing inexperienced volunteers to collect BBS
   data along winter or secondary roads in remote locations.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in raptor populations often result from the transformation of
   natural habitats to anthropogenic land uses, but the rate of population
   change can vary greatly among species. Declines associated with land
   transformation have been linked to loss of foraging habitat, prey
   resources and nest sites due to expanding cultivation, overgrazing and
   disturbance of nests and persecution by humans. We combined extensive
   road-survey counts of raptors, large-scale GIS data sets and a
   single-visit conditional likelihood N-mixture model to generate
   biome-scale projections of abundance as a function of environmental
   covariates while correcting for detection error and other forms of zero
   inflation. This approach was employed to investigate how land-use
   transformations in the threatened Cerrado savannas and Pantanal wetlands
   in Brazil have affected the populations of raptors on a large scale
   (>300000km(2)). We predicted that predominance of land uses with fewer
   or less accessible prey and scarcer nesting sites would sustain smaller
   raptor populations. Twelve species were encountered sufficiently to
   estimate abundance, while 20 others were encountered too infrequently to
   permit abundance estimation. Detection of all 12 species was influenced
   by time of day, with variable species-specific effects that followed
   expectations based on foraging and flight behaviour. Abundance of most
   species was negatively influenced by conversion of natural habitats to
   pastures, an effect that held even for generalist species considered
   poor indicators of habitat quality, but was not universally impacted by
   urbanization and soya beans, sugarcane and Eucalyptus plantations,
   confirming the expectation that some species may tolerate these
   habitats. Spatial projections of abundance appeared realistic for most
   species.Synthesis and applications. Protection of the remaining natural
   habitats is essential to prevent further decline of raptor populations
   in the Brazilian Cerrado and Pantanal, and restoration of unproductive
   pastures into natural habitat could prove an efficient strategy to
   recover diminished raptor populations. The conditional likelihood
   single-visit approach is a valid and useful tool for measuring
   population size and for making detection-corrected inferences of
   abundance over large geographical scales with sensible research budgets.
   Incorporating the approach into a multispecies framework would allow
   future studies to make important inferences for entire communities.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic recordings are increasingly used to quantify occupancy and
   abundance in avian monitoring and research. The recent development of
   relatively inexpensive programmable autonomous recording units (ARUs)
   has further increased the utility of acoustic recording technologies.
   Despite their potential advantages, persistent questions remain as to
   how comparable data are between ARUs and traditional (human observer)
   point counts. We suggest that differences in counts obtained from ARUs
   versus human observers primarily stem from differences in the effective
   detection radius of humans (EDRH) versus ARUs (EDRA). We describe how
   paired sampling can be used in conjunction with generalized linear (GLM)
   or generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to estimate correction factors
   (delta) to remove biases between ARUs and traditional point counts.
   Furthermore, if human observers conduct distance estimation, we show
   that density estimates can be derived from single ARUs by estimating
   EDRA as a function of EDRH and delta, thus providing alternatives to
   more complicated and expensive approaches. We demonstrate our approach
   using data from 363 point count stations in 105 unique boreal study
   sites at which field staff conducted point count surveys that were
   simultaneously recorded by an ARU and later transcribed in the lab.
   Finally, we used repeated random subsampling of the data to split the
   data into model creation (70\%) and validation (30\%) subsets to
   iteratively estimate delta and validate density estimates from ARUs
   against densities calculated from human observers at the same
   independent validation locations. We modeled density of 35 species of
   boreal forest birds and show that incorporating delta in statistical
   offsets successfully removes systematic biases in estimated avian counts
   and/or density between human and ARU derived surveys. Our method is
   therefore easily implemented and will facilitate the integration of ARU
   and human observer point count data, facilitating expanded monitoring
   efforts and meta-analyses with historic point count data.}},

Abstract = {{Point counts are one of the most commonly used methods for assessing
   bird abundance. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) are increasingly being
   used as a replacement for human-based point counts. Previous studies
   have compared the relative benefits of human versus ARU-based point
   count methods, primarily with the goal of understanding differences in
   species richness and the abundance of individuals over an unlimited
   distance. What has not been done is an evaluation of how to standardize
   these two types of data so that they can be compared in the same
   analysis, especially when there are differences in the area sampled. We
   compared detection distances between human observers in the field and
   four commercially available recording devices (Wildlife Acoustics SM2,
   SM3, RiverForks, and Zoom H1) by simulating vocalizations of various
   avian species at different distances and amplitudes. We also
   investigated the relationship between sound amplitude and detection to
   simplify ARU calibration. We used these data to calculate correction
   factors that can be used to standardize detection distances of ARUs
   relative to each other and human observers. In general, humans in the
   field could detect sounds at greater distances than an ARU although
   detectability varied depending on species song characteristics. We
   provide correction factors for four commonly used ARUs and propose
   methods for calibrating ARUs relative to each other and human observers.}},

Abstract = {{Point counts are one of the most common ways of collecting data to
   determine the relative abundance of birds. Many studies and monitoring
   programs, including the North American Breeding Bird Survey, use
   relative differences in counts of birds to assess changes in abundance
   over time and space. Many factors influence whether relative differences
   in counts of birds between various environmental conditions are
   reflective of actual differences in bird density. A major assumption of
   relative abundance is that birds with different song frequencies and
   amplitudes are heard at the same distances in different environmental
   conditions. We compared sound transmission in forest habitats and along
   low-use forestry roads, and calculated detection radius for different
   species to test the assumption that differences in bird counts between
   forest interior and roadside locations reflect actual differences in
   bird abundance. A playback-recording experiment was used to broadcast
   sounds through forest interior, along a forest edge, and down forestry
   roads in conifer and deciduous forests to determine whether sound
   propagation differed across environments. Sound attenuated significantly
   faster in forests than along roads or forest edges. Similarly, the
   distance at which bird songs could be detected was significantly shorter
   in forest than along the road or forest edge for 20 of 25 species. We
   found the area surveyed to be up to twice as large on road compared to
   within forests, which suggests that roadside surveys might inflate avian
   density estimates in comparison to off-road counts. Local atmospheric
   conditions also influenced detection probability, but the magnitude of
   the effect was weaker than the land-cover effect. Major differences in
   detection between roads and interior forest suggest that comparisons of
   surveys conducted along roadsides and in forest areas should be done
   carefully if the goal is to make direct comparisons of abundance.}},

Abstract = {{The specific status of three described taxa belonging to the genus
   Pseudopodisma (P. fieberi, P. transilvanica, P. nagyi) is based on a
   single character, because the original descriptions separate the species
   solely on the basis of genital structure of the males, and the three
   species are seemingly indistinguishable based on external morphology. To
   test this taxonomic separation we conducted morphometric and molecular
   investigations in the genus. Males were a priori identified by the
   original descriptions of the taxa, and from 18 external morphometric
   characters collected, the six most eligible characters of males and
   females were selected for linear discriminant analysis. The linear
   discriminant based classification agreed for 35 (85.3\%) male and 30
   (88.2\%) female specimens out of the 41 a priori identified males and 34
   females. Besides morphometrics, we sequenced the cytochrome b gene with
   newly devised primers in all species plus two outgroups. The
   phylogenetic analysis of resulting sequences indicated a strong
   species-delimitation within the genus Pseudopodisma (i.e., multiple
   individuals of the a priori species formed monophyletic clades). Thus,
   taking the morphometric and molecular results into consideration, we
   conclude the validation of specific status of Pseudopodisma fieberi, P.

Abstract = {{Understanding factors that affect the distribution and abundance of
   species is critical to developing effective management plans for
   conservation. Our goal was to quantify the distribution and abundance of
   Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), a threatened old-forest
   associate in Alberta, Canada. The Canada Warbler has declined across its
   range, including in Alberta where habitat loss and alteration from urban
   expansion, forestry, and energy development are changing the forest
   landscape. We used 110,427 point count survey visits from 32,287 unique
   survey stations to model local-level (150-m radius circular buffers) and
   stand-level (564-m radius circular buffers) habitat associations of the
   Canada Warbler. We found that habitat supporting higher densities of
   Canada Warblers was locally concentrated yet broadly distributed across
   Alberta's boreal forest region. Canada Warblers were most commonly
   associated with older deciduous forest at the local scale, particularly
   near small, incised streams, and greater amounts of deciduous forest at
   the stand scale. Predicted density was lower in other forest types and
   younger age classes measured at the local scale. There was little
   evidence that local-scale fragmentation (i.e., edges created by linear
   features) influenced Canada Warbler abundance. However, current forestry
   practices in the province likely will reduce the availability of Canada
   Warbler habitat over time by cutting old deciduous forest stands. Our
   results suggest that conservation efforts aimed at Canada Warbler focus
   on retaining large stands of old deciduous forest, specifically stands
   adjacent to streams, by increasing the width of deciduous retention
   buffers along streams during harvest and increasing the size and number
   of old forest residual patches in harvested stands.}},

   Values of Boreal Songbirds: Implications for Assignment to Molt Origin}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Understanding bird migration and dispersal is important to inform full
   life-cycle conservation planning. Stable hydrogen isotope ratios from
   feathers (delta H-2(f)) can be linked to amount-weighted long-term,
   growing season precipitation delta H-2 (delta H-2(p)) surfaces to create
   delta H-2(f) isoscapes for assignment to molt origin. However, transfer
   functions linking delta H-2(p) with delta H-2(f) are influenced by
   physiological and environmental processes. A better understanding of the
   causes and consequences of variation in delta H-2(f) values among
   individuals and species will improve the predictive ability of
   geographic assignment tests. We tested for effects of species, land
   cover, forage substrate, nest substrate, diet composition, body mass,
   sex, and phylogenetic relatedness on delta H-2(f) from individuals at
   least two years old of 21 songbird species captured during the same
   breeding season at a site in northeastern Alberta, Canada. For four
   species, we also tested for a year x species interaction effect on delta
   H-2(f). A model including species as single predictor received the most
   support (AIC weight = 0.74) in explaining variation in delta H-2(f). A
   species-specific variance parameter was part of all best-ranked models,
   suggesting variation in delta H-2(f) was not consistent among species.
   The second best-ranked model included a forage substrate x diet
   interaction term (AIC weight = 0.16). There was a significant year x
   species interaction effect on delta H-2(f) suggesting that interspecific
   differences in delta H-2(f) can differ among years. Our results suggest
   that within and among-year interspecific variation in delta H-2(f) is
   the most important source of variance typically not being explicitly
   quantified in geographic assignment tests using non-specific transfer
   functions to convert delta H-2(p) into delta H-2(f). However, this
   source of variation is consistent with the range of variation from the
   transfer functions most commonly being propagated in assignment tests of
   geographic origins for passerines breeding in North America.}},

Abstract = {{Responses of boreal birds to changes in forest structure and composition
   caused by construction of well pads, seismic lines, and pipelines are
   poorly understood. Bird species associated with older forests are
   predicted to experience larger population declines with increased
   disturbance compared with species associated with younger or open
   habitats; however, point count methods may influence apparent outcomes
   because the proportional area of disturbed vegetation and the magnitude,
   uncertainty, and detection of a disturbance response by birds vary as a
   function of sampling area. We analyzed point count data from 12 energy
   sector studies and measured how disturbance type and point count radius
   interacted to affect 531 impact ratios (mean abundance at point counts
   centered within disturbances relative to abundance at point counts
   within forest 150-400 m from the nearest edge bordering those
   disturbances {[}59 species{*}3 disturbance types{*}3 point count
   radii]). We observed larger disturbance effects (impact ratios) within
   larger-radius point counts at well pads (100-m and unlimited-distance)
   and pipelines (unlimited-distance) compared with 50-m point counts at
   seismic lines, and within 50-m point counts at well pads relative to
   50-m point counts at seismic lines. Effect uncertainty was higher at
   well pads and pipelines than seismic lines, and lower within
   larger-radius point counts. The probability of detecting a disturbance
   response was greater for larger-radius point counts at pipelines than
   for 50-m point counts at seismic lines, and within 50-m point counts at
   well pads relative to 50-m point counts at seismic lines. On average, a
   species was more likely to increase in abundance near an energy sector
   disturbance if the species was not associated with older (>75 yr) forest
   stages. While the effects of disturbance varied by species and with
   disturbance type, the effects of pipelines and seismic lines were better
   detected by larger-radius point counts, while the effects of well pads
   were better detected by smaller-radius point counts.}},

Abstract = {{Models accounting for imperfect detection are important. Single-visit
   (SV) methods have been proposed as an alternative to multiple-visit
   methods to relax the assumption of closed population. Knape \&
   Korner-Nievergelt (Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2015) showed that
   under certain models of probability of detection, SV methods are
   statistically non-identifiable leading to biased population estimates.
   There is a close relationship between estimation of the resource
   selection probability function (RSPF) using weighted distributions and
   SV methods for occupancy and abundance estimation. We explain the
   precise mathematical conditions needed for RSPF estimation as stated in
   Lele \& Keim (Ecology, 87, 2006, 3021). The identical conditions that
   remained unstated in our papers on SV methodology are needed for SV
   methodology to work. We show that the class of admissible models is
   quite broad and does not excessively restrict the application of the
   RSPF or the SV methodology. To complement the work by Knape and
   Korner-Nievergelt, we study the performance of multiple-visit methods
   under the scaled logistic detection function and a much wider set of
   situations. In general, under the scaled logistic detection function,
   multiple-visit methods also lead to biased estimates. As a solution to
   this problem, we extend the SV methodology to a class of models that
   allows use of scaled probability function. We propose a multinomial
   extension of SV methodology that can be used to check whether the
   detection function satisfies the RSPF condition or not. Furthermore, we
   show that if the scaling factor depends on covariates, then it can also
   be estimated. We argue that the instances where the RSPF condition is
   not satisfied are rare in practice. Hence, we disagree with the
   implication in Knape \& Korner-Nievergelt (Methods in Ecology and
   Evolution, 2015) that the need for RSPF condition makes SV methodology
   irrelevant in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Direct and indirect effects of disturbance may cause the decline of
   specialist species and alter the condition of ecological communities. We
   characterized the community structure and niche characteristics (niche
   position, marginality, breadth) of upland and lowland boreal birds at
   scales relevant to both natural and human disturbance patterns in
   western boreal forests undergoing rapid and extensive multi-sector
   resource development. Our goal was to identify the degree of ecological
   specialization in order to inform activities directed at conserving a
   diversity of species (e.g. specialists and generalists) within the
   western boreal bird community. We used avian data (>5,220 point counts)
   and environmental variable data comprised of forest composition, stand,
   and landscape pattern metrics at local (7.1 ha), landscape (1,963 ha),
   and regional (11,310 ha) scales to determine boreal bird distribution
   and community-level associations using Canonical Correspondence Analysis
   (CCA) and Outlying Mean Index (OMl) analysis. OMI analysis explained a
   high proportion of variance in the ``dataset (71.8\%) and separated
   boreal birds along two axes associated with moisture-productivity and
   age-structural complexity gradients. Niche position was influenced by
   local scale variables (height, age, area of mature-old forest, area of
   wet soil types), but also landscape and regional scale variables (total
   area of hardwood and conifer, mean nearest neighbour distance of
   conifer, and total core area of productive upland conifer). Only 15 of
   67 species (22\%) had marginal (atypical) niches and narrow niche
   breadths exhibiting specialization in old hardwood and white spruce
   forests and burned, open, and lowland habitats. Most species occupied
   typical or common habitats within the study area and exhibited
   generalist strategies typical of species in heterogeneous and disturbed
   habitats that undergo frequent change. Our results suggest the need to
   design and implement multi-species plans to conserve a diversity of
   western boreal bird species (e.g. specialists and generalists) at the
   regional scale. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) monitors
   large-scale responses of biodiversity to environmental change in
   Alberta, Canada, based on standardized and ongoing data collection. In
   this case study, we show that such a standardized monitoring system has
   many data management challenges. In the almost 20 years since the
   conception of the Institute, we have identified 4 key characteristics
   that are required for large-scale, long-term biodiversity monitoring
   programs to be operational: 1) data must be publicly accessible; 2)
   methods and terminology must be standardized to facilitate consistency
   around data and information collection, analysis, and reporting; 3) the
   information system must be flexible so that components can be modified
   or added without compromising the functionality of the other components
   or the whole system; and 4) the system must be scalable so that it can
   support input, storage, and retrieval as data load increases. These
   characteristics are important to ensure that the products and tools

Abstract = {{To accomplish the objectives of a long-term ecological monitoring
   program (LTEM), repurposing research data collected by other researchers
   is an alternative to original data collection. The Boreal Avian
   Modelling (BAM) Project is a 10-year-old project that has integrated the
   data from >100 avian point-count studies encompassing thousands of
   point-count surveys, and harmonized across data sets to account for
   heterogeneity induced by methodological and other differences. The BAM
   project faced the classic data-management challenges any LTEM must deal
   with, as well as special challenges involved with harmonizing so many
   disparate data sources. We created a data system consisting of 4
   components: Archive (to preserve each contributor's data), Avian
   Database (harmonized point-count data), Biophysical Database (spatially
   explicit environmental covariates), and Software Tools library (linking
   the other components and providing analysis capability). This system has
   allowed the project to answer many questions about boreal birds; we
   believe it to be successful enough to merit consideration for use in
   monitoring other taxa. We have learned a number of lessons that will
   guide the project as it moves forward. These include the importance of
   creating a data protocol, the critical importance of high-quality
   metadata, and the need for a flexible design that accommodates changes
   in field techniques. One of the challenges the BAM team faced-gaining
   access to relevant data sets-may become easier with the increased
   expectation by journals and funding agencies that documenting and
   preserving research data be a standard part of scientific research. (C)

Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{AimSpecies and ecosystems may be unable to keep pace with rapid climate
   change projected for the 21st century. We evaluated an underexplored
   dimension of the mismatch between climate and biota: limitations to
   forest growth and succession affecting habitat suitability. Our
   objective was to inform continental-scale conservation for boreal
   songbirds under disequilibria between climate, vegetation and fauna.
   LocationBoreal and southern arctic ecoregions of North America.
   MethodsWe used forest inventory and avian survey data to classify 53
   species by seral-stage affinity and applied these to generate
   alternative projections of changes in species' core habitat
   distributions based on different vegetation lag-time assumptions. We
   used our seral stage-modified refugia approach and the Zonation
   algorithm to identify multispecies boreal conservation priorities over
   the 21st century. We evaluated the sensitivity of land rankings to
   seral-stage affinity and species' weights and assessed the conservation
   value of the existing protected areas network compared to Zonation
   results.
   ResultsEnd-of-century projected changes in songbird distribution were
   reduced by up to 169\% when vegetation lags were considered. Zonation
   land rankings based on unconstrained climate projections were
   concentrated at high latitudes, whereas those based on strict and
   modified refugia scenarios were concentrated in coastal and
   high-elevation areas, as well as biome transition zones, which were
   fairly consistent over time and species weights. The existing protected
   areas network covering 14\% of the study area was estimated to conserve
   12-14\% of baseline avian biodiversity across time periods and
   scenarios, compared to 16-25\% for top-ranked Zonation areas.
   Main conclusionsFor some boreal songbirds, limits to forest growth and
   succession may result in dramatic reductions in suitable habitat over
   the next century. Our seral stage-adjusted approach provides
   conservative and efficient boreal conservation priorities anchored
   around climatic macrorefugia that are robust to century-long climate
   change and complement the current protected areas network.}},

Title = {{Projecting boreal bird responses to climate change: the signal exceeds

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{52-69}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{For climate change projections to be useful, the magnitude of change
   must be understood relative to the magnitude of uncertainty in model
   predictions. We quantified the signal-to-noise ratio in projected
   distributional responses of boreal birds to climate change, and compared
   sources of uncertainty. Boosted regression tree models of abundance were
   generated for 80 boreal-breeding bird species using a comprehensive data
   set of standardized avian point counts (349 629 surveys at 122 202
   unique locations) and 4-km climate, land use, and topographic data. For
   projected changes in abundance, we calculated signal-to-noise ratios and
   examined variance components related to choice of global climatemodel
   (GCM) and two sources of species distribution model (SDM) uncertainty:
   sampling error and variable selection. We also evaluated spatial,
   temporal, and interspecific variation in these sources of uncertainty.
   The mean signal-to-noise ratio across species increased over time to
   2.87 by the end of the 21st century, with the signal greater than the
   noise for 88\% of species. Across species, climate change represented
   the largest component (0.44) of variance in projected abundance change.
   Among sources of uncertainty evaluated, choice of GCM (mean variance
   component = 0.17) was most important for 66\% of species, sampling error
   (mean = 0.12) for 29\% of species, and variable selection (mean = 0.05)
   for 5\% of species. Increasing the number of GCMs from four to 19 had
   minor effects on these results. The range of projected changes and
   uncertainty characteristics across species differed markedly,
   reinforcing the individuality of species' responses to climate change
   and the challenges of one-size-fits-all approaches to climate change
   adaptation. We discuss the usefulness of different conservation
   approaches depending on the strength of the climate change signal
   relative to the noise, as well as the dominant source of prediction
   uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{We determined microhabitat associations for 39 land snail species based
   on multimodel inference and generalized linear mixed models using a
   comprehensive and micro-scale data set from the Aggtelek Karst Area,
   Hungary. Patterns of microhabitat associations were highly nested among
   microhabitat types (litter, live trees, dead wood, rock) with high
   number of specialist species in dead wood and in rock microhabitats.
   Species composition was highly predictable in these microhabitats as
   opposed to live tree and litter faunas. Species richness was affected by
   microhabitat, topographic factors and local moisture conditions. Species
   richness in dead wood and rock microhabitats remained high irrespective
   of the topographic effects as opposed to litter and live tree
   microhabitats, where richness decreased with drier microhabitat
   conditions due to topography. Our results imply that consideration of
   topographic factors and microhabitat quality as part of coarse filter
   conservation measures could be beneficial to local land snail
   populations in the face of changing climate and disturbance regimes.}},

Abstract = {{We revisit the common standards recommended by Ralph et al. (1993,
   1995a) for conducting point-count surveys to assess the relative
   abundance of landbirds breeding in North America. The standards
   originated from discussions among ornithologists in 1991 and were
   developed so that point-count survey data could be broadly compared and
   jointly analyzed by national data centers with the goals of monitoring
   populations and managing habitat. Twenty years later, we revisit these
   standards because (1) they have not been universally followed and (2)
   new methods allow estimation of absolute abundance from point counts,
   but these methods generally require data beyond the original standards
   to account for imperfect detection. Lack of standardization and the
   complications it introduces for analysis become apparent from aggregated
   data. For example, only 3\% of 196,000 point counts conducted during the
   period 1992-2011 across Alaska and Canada followed the standards
   recommended for the count period and count radius. Ten-minute,
   unlimited-count-radius surveys increased the number of birds detected by
   >300\% over 3-minute, 50-m-radius surveys. This effect size, which could
   be eliminated by standardized sampling, was >= 10 times the published
   effect sizes of observers, time of day, and date of the surveys. We
   suggest that the recommendations by Ralph et al. (1995a) continue to
   form the common standards when conducting point counts. This protocol is
   inexpensive and easy to follow but still allows the surveys to be
   adjusted for detection probabilities. Investigators might optionally
   collect additional information so that they can analyze their data with
   more flexible forms of removal and time-of-detection models, distance
   sampling, multiple-observer methods, repeated counts, or combinations of
   these methods. Maintaining the common standards as a base protocol, even
   as these study-specific modifications are added, will maximize the value
   of point-count data, allowing compilation and analysis by regional and
   national data centers.}},

Abstract = {{AimAlthough the increase in species richness with increasing area is
   considered one of the few laws in ecology, the role of environmental and
   taxon-specific features in shaping species-area relationships (SARs)
   remains controversial. Using 421 land-plant floras covering continents,
   continental islands and oceanic islands, we investigate whether
   variations in SAR parameters can be interpreted in terms of differences
   among lineages in speciation mode and dispersal capacities (TAXON), or
   of geological history and geographical isolation between continents and
   islands (GEO).
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsLinear mixed-effects models describing variation in SARs,
   depending on the factors GEO and TAXON and controlling for differences
   between realms (REALM) and biomes (BIOME).
   ResultsThe best random-effect structure included both random slopes and
   random intercepts for GEO, TAXON, REALM and BIOME. This accounted for
   77\% of the total variation in species richness, substantially more than
   the 27\% statistically explained by the model with fixed effects only
   (i.e. the simple SAR). The slopes of the SARs were higher for oceanic
   islands than for continental islands and continents, and higher in
   spermatophytes than in pteridophytes and bryophytes. The intercepts
   largely exhibited the reverse trend. TAXON was included in best-fit
   models restricted to oceanic and continental islands, but not
   continents. Analysing each plant lineage separately, the intercept of
   GEO was only included in the random structure of spermatophytes.
   Main conclusionsSAR parameters varied considerably depending on
   geological history and taxon-specific traits. Such differences in SARs
   among land plants challenge the neutral theory that the accumulation of
   species richness on islands is controlled exclusively by extrinsic
   factors. Taxon-specific differences in SARs were, however, confounded by
   interactions with geological history and geographical isolation. This
   highlights the importance of applying integrative frameworks that take
   both environmental context and taxonomic idiosyncrasies into account in
   SAR analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Effective ecological monitoring is imperative in a human-dominated
   world, as our ability to manage functioning ecosystems will depend on
   understanding biodiversity responses to anthropogenic impacts. Yet, most
   monitoring efforts have either been narrowly focused on particular
   sites, species and stressors - thus inadequately considering the
   cumulative effects of multiple, interacting impacts at scales of
   management relevance - or too unfocused to provide specific guidance. We
   propose a cumulative effects monitoring framework that integrates
   multi-scaled surveillance of trends in biodiversity and land cover with
   targeted evaluation of hypothesized drivers of change. The framework is
   grounded in a flexible conceptual model and uses monitoring to generate
   and test empirical models that relate the status of diverse taxonomic
   groups to the nature and extent of human ``footprint{''} and other
   landscape attributes. An adaptive cycle of standardized sampling, model
   development, and model evaluation provides a means to learn about the
   system and guide management. Additional benefits of the framework
   include standardized data on status and trend for a wide variety of
   biodiversity elements, spatially explicit models for regional planning
   and scenario evaluation, and identification of knowledge gaps for
   complementary research. We describe efforts to implement the framework
   in Alberta, Canada, through the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring
   Institute, and identify key challenges to be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental factors controlling the distribution and abundance of
   boreal avifauna are not fully understood, limiting our ability to
   predict the consequences of a changing climate and industrial
   development activities underway. We used a compilation of avian
   point-count data, collected over 1990-2008 from nearly 36 000 locations,
   to model the abundance of individual forest songbird species within the
   Canadian boreal forest. We evaluated 30 vegetation and 101 climatic
   variables, representing most of the widely-used dimensions of climate
   space, along with less usual measures of inter-annual variability.
   Regression tree models allowed us to calculate the relative importance
   of climate and vegetation variable classes according to avian migration
   strategy without the need for a priori variable selection or dimension
   reduction. We tested for hierarchical habitat selection by formulating
   hypotheses on the locations of variables within the model tree
   structures. Climate variables explained the majority (77\%) of deviance
   explained over 98 species modelled. As may be expected at high
   latitudes, we found energy availability (temperature, 65\%) to be more
   important than moisture availability (precipitation, 12\%). The
   contributions of inter- and intra-annual climate variability (28\%) were
   about half that of mean conditions. The relatively large contribution of
   remotely-sensed vegetation metrics (23\%) highlighted the importance of
   local vegetation heterogeneity controlled by non-climatic factors. The
   two most important vegetation variables were landcover type and April
   leaf area index. When selected, these generally occurred in a model's
   right subtree, consistent with predictions from hierarchical habitat
   selection theory. When occupying the root node, landcover effectively
   delineated the historical forest-prairie ecotone, reflecting the current
   disequilibrium between climate and vegetation due to human land use. Our
   findings suggest a large potential for avian distributional shifts in
   response to climate change, but also demonstrate the importance of finer
   scale vegetation heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of boreal
   birds.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the feasibility of proposed Bird Conservation Region (BCR)
   population objectives requires comparing expected future population size
   estimates to proposed population objectives. Linking statistical bird
   habitat models with landscape simulation models can provide a direct
   method for assessing the ecological and economic implications of
   alternative land and resource scenarios within a BCR or BCR sub-region.
   We demonstrate our approach for analyses of future habitat supply and
   population size for a suite of priority landbird species using the ALCES
   (R) landscape simulation model and empirical bird habitat models within
   a multi-use landscape located in northeast Alberta, Canada and BCR
   6-Boreal Taiga Plains. We used ALCES (R) to simulate future landscape
   condition over a 100 year time period under three scenarios: business as
   usual, protected areas, and climate change. Shortfalls between simulated
   population size estimates at year 30 and proposed population objectives
   existed for each of the four priority bird species examined suggesting
   that expected future landscape condition will not support proposed
   population objectives for these species. Boreal species strongly
   associated with mature and old forest habitats exhibited population
   declines over the 100 year simulation period. One habitat generalist, a
   species associated with both early and late seral stages, appeared to
   benefit from the range of land use scenarios examined. Our approach
   improves upon current static approaches used to step down BCR scale
   population objectives to sub-regional scale habitat objectives by
   utilizing statistical bird population response models to estimate
   density and a dynamic landscape simulation model to estimate expected
   future habitat condition. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{1. The analysis of large heterogeneous data sets of avian point-count
   surveys compiled across studies is hindered by a lack of analytical
   approaches that can deal with detectability and variation in survey
   protocols.
   2. We reformulated removal models of avian singing rates and distance
   sampling models of the effective detection radius (EDR) to control for
   the effects of survey protocol and temporal and environmental covariates
   on detection probabilities.
   3. We estimated singing rates and EDR for 75 boreal forest songbird
   species and found that survey protocol, especially point-count radius,
   explained most of the variation in detectability. However, environmental
   and temporal covariates (date, time, vegetation) affected singing rates
   and EDR for 73\% and 59\% of species, respectively.
   4. Unadjusted survey counts increased by an average of 201\% from a
   5-min, 50-m radius survey to a 10-min, 100-m radius survey (n = 75
   species). This variability was decreased to 8<bold>5</bold>\% using
   detection probabilities estimated from a combination of removal and
   distance sampling models.
   5. Our modelling approach reduced computation when fitting complex
   models to large data sets and can be used with a wide range of
   statistical techniques for inference and prediction of avian densities.}},

Abstract = {{Data frames are integral to R. They provide a standard format for
   passing data to model-fitting and plotting functions, and this standard
   makes it easier for experienced users to learn new functions that accept
   data as a single data frame. Still, many data sets do not easily fit
   into a single data frame; data sets in ecology with a so-called
   fourth-corner problem provide important examples. Manipulating such
   inherently multiple-table data using several data frames can result in
   long and difficult-to-read workflows. We introduce the R multitable
   package to provide new data storage objects called data.list
   objects,which extend the data.frame concept to explicitly multiple-table
   settings. Like data frames, data lists are lists of variables stored as
   vectors; what is new is that these vectors have dimension attributes
   that make accessing and manipulating them easier. As data.list objects
   can be coerced to data.frame objects, they can be used with all R
   functions that accept an object that is coercible to a data.frame.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The worldwide biodiversity crisis has intensified the need to better
   understand how biodiversity and human disturbance are related. The
   `intermediate disturbance hypothesis' suggests that disturbance regimes
   generate predictable non-linear patterns in species richness. Evidence
   often contradicts intermediate disturbance hypothesis at small scales,
   and is generally lacking at large regional scales. Here, we present the
   largest extent study of human impacts on boreal plant biodiversity to
   date. Disturbance extent ranged from 0 to 100\% disturbed in vascular
   plant communities, varying from intact forest to agricultural fields,
   forestry cut blocks and oil sands. We show for the first time that
   across a broad region species richness peaked in communities with
   intermediate anthropogenic disturbance, as predicted by intermediate
   disturbance hypothesis, even when accounting for many environmental
   covariates. Intermediate disturbance hypothesis was consistently
   supported across trees, shrubs, forbs and grasses, with temporary and
   perpetual disturbances. However, only native species fit this pattern;
   exotic species richness increased linearly with disturbance.}},

Title = {{USING BINOMIAL DISTANCE-SAMPLING MODELS TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTIVE

Journal = {{AUK}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{129}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{268-282}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We used binomial distance-sampling models to estimate the effective
   detection radius (EDR) of point-count surveys across boreal Canada. We
   evaluated binomial models based on 0-50 m and >50 m distance categories
   for goodness-of-fit and sensitivities to variation in survey effort and
   habitats sampled. We also compared binomial EDRs to Partners in Flight's
   maximum detection distances (MDD) to determine differences in landbird
   population sizes derived from each. Binomial EDRs had a small positive
   bias (4\%) averaged across 86 species and a large positive bias
   (30-82\%) for two species when compared with EDRs estimated using
   multinomial distance sampling. Patterns in binomial EDRs were consistent
   with how bird songs attenuate in relation to their frequencies and
   transmission through different habitats. EDR varied 12\% among habitats
   and increased 17\% when birds were counted to an unlimited distance,
   compared with a limited distance of 100 m. The EDR did not vary with the
   duration of surveys, and densities did not differ when using
   unlimited-distance versus truncated data. Estimated densities, however,
   increased 19\% from 3- to 5-min counts and 25\% from 5- to 10-min
   counts, possibly from increases in the availability, movement, or double
   counting of birds with longer counts. Thus, investigators should be
   cautious when comparing distance-sampling results among studies if
   methods vary. Population sizes estimated using EDR averaged 5 times
   (0.8-15 times) those estimated with MDD. Survey data from which to
   estimate binomial EDRs are widely available across North America and
   could be used as an alternative to MDD when estimating landbird
   population sizes. Received 31 August 2011, accepted 31 January 2012.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Current methods to correct for detection error require multiple visits
   to the same survey location. Many historical datasets exist that were
   collected using only a single visit, and logistical/cost considerations
   prevent many current research programs from collecting multiple visit
   data. In this paper, we explore what can be done with single visit count
   data when there is detection error. We show that when appropriate
   covariates that affect both detection and abundance are available,
   conditional likelihood can be used to estimate the regression parameters
   of a binomialzero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) mixture model and correct for
   detection error. We use observed counts of Ovenbirds (Seiurus
   aurocapilla) to illustrate the estimation of the parameters for the
   binomialzero-inflated Poisson mixture model using a subset of data from
   one of the largest and longest ecological time series datasets that only
   has single visits. Our single visit method has the following
   characteristics: (i) it does not require the assumptions of a closed
   population or adjustments caused by movement or migration; (ii) it is
   cost effective, enabling ecologists to cover a larger geographical
   region than possible when having to return to sites; and (iii) its
   resultant estimators appear to be statistically and computationally
   highly efficient. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We conducted a meta-analysis of speciesarea relationships (SARs) by
   combining several data sets and important covariates such as types of
   islands, taxonomic groups, latitude and spatial extent, in a
   hierarchical model framework to study global pattern and local variation
   in SARs and its consequences for prediction.
   Location One thousand nine hundred and eighteen islands from 94 SAR
   studies from around the world.
   Methods We developed a generalization of the power-law SAR model, the
   HSARX model, which allows: (1) the inclusion of multiple focal
   parameters (intercept, slope, within-study variance), (2) use of
   multiple effect modifiers based on a collection of SAR studies, and (3)
   modelling of the between-and within-study variability.
   Results The global pattern in the SAR was the average of local SARs and
   had wide confidence intervals. The global SAR slope was 0.228 with 90\%
   confidence limits of 0.059 and 0.412. The intercept, slope and
   within-study variability of local SARs showed great heterogeneity as a
   result of the interaction of modifying covariates. Confidence intervals
   for these SAR parameters were narrower when other covariates in addition
   to area were accounted for, thus increasing the accuracy of the
   predictions for species richness. The significant effect of latitude and
   the interaction of latitude, taxa and island type on the SAR slope
   indicated that the `typical' latitudinal diversity gradient can be
   reversed in isolated systems.
   Main conclusions The power-law relationship underlying the HSARX model
   provides a good fit for non-nested SARs across vastly different spatial
   scales by taking into account other covariates. The HSARX framework
   allows researchers to explore the complex interactions among SAR
   parameters and modifying variables, to explicitly study the scale
   dependence, and to make robust predictions on multiple levels (island,
   study, global) with associated prediction intervals. From a prediction
   perspective, it is not the global pattern but the local variation that
   matters.}},

Abstract = {{We studied abundance and diversity patterns of terrestrial isopod
   assemblages along a `micro-scale' vertical gradient in sinkholes in the
   Aggtelek National Park, Hungary. Time restricted manual sampling yielded
   ten native species, including endemic and rare ones. Along the gradient
   we found no major differences in species richness and -composition, and
   abundance decreased from the bottoms to the upper zones of the
   sinkholes. Species specific habitat preference on a vertical gradient
   showed two distinct groups by indicator species analysis: occurrence of
   habitat ``generalists{''} was irrespective of vertical zones while
   ``specialists{''} were restricted to the bottoms of the dolines. The
   latter group is formed mainly by rare species. We found that both
   diversity and evenness of isopod assemblages were highest in the bottom
   zone. Our results draw the attention to the significance of such common,
   yet undiscovered surficial depressions that can provide shelters for
   rare and specialist species and can provide shelter for survival of
   populations under changing climatic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms provide some of the most sensitive indicators of climate
   change and evolutionary responses are becoming apparent in species with
   short generation times. Large datasets on genetic polymorphism that can
   provide an historical benchmark against which to test for recent
   evolutionary responses are very rare, but an exception is found in the
   brown-lipped banded snail (Cepaea nemoralis). This species is sensitive
   to its thermal environment and exhibits several polymorphisms of shell
   colour and banding pattern affecting shell albedo in the majority of
   populations within its native range in Europe. We tested for
   evolutionary changes in shell albedo that might have been driven by the
   warming of the climate in Europe over the last half century by compiling
   an historical dataset for 6,515 native populations of C. nemoralis and
   comparing this with new data on nearly 3,000 populations. The new data
   were sampled mainly in 2009 through the Evolution MegaLab, a citizen
   science project that engaged thousands of volunteers in 15 countries
   throughout Europe in the biggest such exercise ever undertaken. A known
   geographic cline in the frequency of the colour phenotype with the
   highest albedo (yellow) was shown to have persisted and a difference in
   colour frequency between woodland and more open habitats was confirmed,
   but there was no general increase in the frequency of yellow shells.
   This may have been because snails adapted to a warming climate through
   behavioural thermoregulation. By contrast, we detected an unexpected
   decrease in the frequency of Unbanded shells and an increase in the
   Mid-banded morph. Neither of these evolutionary changes appears to be a
   direct response to climate change, indicating that the influence of
   other selective agents, possibly related to changing predation pressure
   and habitat change with effects on micro-climate.}},

   qualitative data, and since than, data have increased significantly and
   more efficient methods become available. I used UTM based distribution
   data of 121 land snail species to quantitatively assess biogeographic
   patterns in Hungary. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified two main
   clusters of areas: highlands and lowlands. This dichotomy can be
   attributed to mainly climatic and altitudinal differences. One fourth of
   the species were present in the whole country (general species), one
   fourth was characteristic to highlands, and half of the species
   (including all the endemics) were localized in smaller regions. The
   distribution of localized species revealed historical effects in
   regional faunas: Carpathian influences in the Northern Mountains, Alpine
   influences in the Western Marginal Area, and southern-Illyric influences
   in Southern Transdanubia. Biotic element analysis revealed that
   clustering of species ranges did not differed significantly from the
   null model, but species' areas were significantly more nested that under
   the null model. Based on the high degree of nedtedness in species' areas
   and the composition of various biogeographical influences,
   representativeness can be achieved with relative efficiency in Hungary.}},

Abstract = {{Legal instruments for species conservation have been criticised because
   they take a long time to draw up and implement and because invertebrates
   are highly underrepresented. For these reasons legal documents need
   regular re-evaluation as more data and effective methods are available.
   The effectiveness of the Hungarian legislative texts was assessed by the
   congruence between protection status and conservation priority of the
   species. Species were prioritised according to the conservation priority
   index (CPI = MRI x PBR), which included mollusca rarity index (MRI) and
   protection-by-reserves score (PBR). Mollusca rarity index was an
   additive scoring method including global range size, local frequency,
   and a correction factor due to the biased frequency estimate or special
   importance of some species. PBR scores expressed the lack of congruence
   between distribution of reserves and distribution of species. I used the
   distribution data of 121 Hungarian land snail species based on 10 x 10
   km resolution grid system. Current protection status of the species was
   associated with rarity, whereas the congruence between species
   occurrences and the location of existing reserves has been overlooked.
   Based on the 25\% of the species with highest CPI scores, the species
   Helicigona planospira was highly recommended and 9 other species was
   recommended for protection. Two thirds of the occurrences of the
   strictly protected and endemic species Hygromia kovacsi and more than
   25\% of the occurrences of 10 protected species were located outside of
   current reserves. Local populations of these species need monitoring in
   order to detect changes in the area of occupancy.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of accurate species databases is debated in the recent
   literature of biodiversity assessment, considering that limited
   resources for conservation could be better allocated to assessment based
   on cost effective biodiversity features. I aimed to provide an
   understanding of sampling bias and provide practical advice to minimize
   bias either before or after data collection. I used 10x10 km(2) UTM grid
   data for 121 land snail species to account for geographic and taxonomic
   sampling bias in Hungary. Sampling intensity corrected for species
   richness varied significantly among regions, although regions were not
   good predictors of sampling intensity. Residuals were significantly
   autocorrelated in 15 km distance, indicating small scale heterogeneity
   in sampling intensity compared to species richness. Sampling coverage
   and intensity were higher close to human settlements and sampling
   intensity was higher within protected areas than outside. Commonness of
   species was positively associated with sampling intensity, while some
   rare species were over-represented in the records. Sampling intensity of
   microsnails (<3 mm) was significantly lower than that of the more
   detectable large species (> 15 mm). Systematic effects of the collecting
   methods used in malacological research may be responsible for these
   differences. Understanding causes of sampling bias may help to reduce
   its effects in ecological, biogeographical and conservation biological
   applications, and help to guide future research.}},

Abstract = {{The preservation of biodiversity requires high-quality data and
   efficient methods for prioritizing species and sites for conservation.
   We examined the distribution data of 121 Hungarian land snail species in
   a 10 x 10 km resolution grid system. The spatial consistency of the data
   set varied significantly among regions, so we excluded cells with <5
   species. Thus we used data from 512 out of 1052 grid cells. We
   prioritized Hungarian land snail species based on an additive scoring
   index ranging from 2 to 10 in which higher scores indicate rarer
   species. The index included global-range size, local frequency, and a
   correction factor because of the biased frequency estimate or special
   importance of some species. We analyzed the relationship between
   protection status and rarity scores for each species. There were 15
   unprotected species of land snails out of 30 considered rare, according
   to the quartile definition of rarity, and 16 protected species fell out
   of the score range of rare species. Four of these protected species are
   threatened by other than their restricted ranges (e.g., habitat loss and
   overexploitation). We prioritized areas by simple-ranking and
   complementary-areas methods based on species richness (SR), sum of
   rarity scores (RS), 25\% rarest species richness (SQ), and a
   multiple-criteria index (SSQ=SR x {[}SQ+1]). In the area-selection
   procedures the indices based on the quartile definition of rarity (SQ
   and SSQ) were slightly more efficient in representing species than
   species richness and sum of rarity scores. We also made regional
   comparisons, identified hotspots at the national scale, and investigated
   the overlap between hotspots and existing reserve areas. The
   distribution of species richness and rarity among the main geographical
   regions of Hungary revealed differences between lowland and highland
   areas. Most of the hotspots were located in the mountain areas and
   isolated hotspots were identified in lowland areas. All species of
   Hungarian land snails occurred within current protected areas, but
   selected hotspots did not overlap with current protected areas in all
   cases. The location of protected areas in Hungary is adequate to
   preserve land snails, although we recommend that unprotected hotspots be
   considered for protection.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in soil invertebrates,
   particularly in isopods, are almost absent so far. As a result,
   methodology of measuring FA in isopods is little known. However, the
   ecological importance of these animals in decomposition processes and
   the fact that FA in soil invertebrates might serve as an indicator of
   environmental stress, e.g. soil pollution, make the topic worth for
   investigation. Our results revealed that woodlice are potentially able
   to signal environmental stresses via FA. We compared six traits (length
   of three segments of antennae, two segments of the seventh legs and the
   number of ocelli) between two populations (Hungary: Hajos,
   Blaskovics-puszta) and genders of the species Trachelipus rathkii living
   under different environmental stresses (i.e. changing humidity).
   Asymmetry was significantly higher in the Hajos population, where the
   soil moisture has changed dramatically for the last years. Asymmetry was
   lower in Blaskovics-puszta, where the habitat has remained constant
   during the last centuries and the population had time to adapt to
   seasonally changing environments. Gender did not have an effect on FA.
   Traits differed significantly from each other, thus it is advisable to
   use several traits simultaneously to detect FA. FA was higher in the a1
   segment of the antennal flagellae than in the ischium of the pereiopod
   and ocelli. We also studied the effect of regeneration of lost body
   parts on the FA values. Asymmetry in the treated groups was
   significantly higher than in the control ones. This calls the attention
   to the problem of outliers, which may be caused by physical harm and can
   lead to artificial results. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.}},
