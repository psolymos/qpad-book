# Data ...

It is often called:

- processing,
- munging,
- wrangling,
- cleaning.

None of these expressions capture the dread associated with the actual activity.

_"All data are messy, but some are missing."_

***

# The evil trio

Luckily, there are only 4 things that can get messed up:

- space (e.g. wrong UTM zones),
- time (ISO format please),
- taxonomy (UNK, mis-ID),
- something else.

Check out source code if you are interested in data processing,
we skip that for now to concentrate on the fun part.

# JOSM (Joint Oil Sands Monitoring) data

```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="220px"}
include_graphics("../_images/mahon-2016-fig-1.png")
```

Cause-Effect Monitoring Migratory Landbirds at Regional Scales[^1][^2]: 
understand how boreal songbirds are affected by human activity in the oil sands area.

# Survey design

\centering
```{r echo=FALSE,out.width="250px"}
include_graphics("../_images/mahon-2016-fig-2.png")
```

Survey area boundary ($r$=2.5 km circle), habitat type and human footprint mapping, 
and clustered point count site locations.

# Sample and replication

- We want to make inferences about a population,
- full census is out of reach,
- thus we take a sample of the population
- that is representative and random.
- Ideally, sample size should be as large as possible,
- it reduces variability and 
- increases statistical power.

***

# How do we pick where to survey?

- Stratification,
- gradients,
- random location (control for unmeasured effects),
- take into account historical surveys (avoid, or revisit),
- access, cost (clusters).

# Dive into the JOMS data now

```{r echo}
